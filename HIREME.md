#HIREME
###Who am I?
Hi there! I am Amanda Quaranto: an engineer turned novice programmer. I am seeking an internship to learn more about the field and to eventually obtain full-time employment as a developer.   
  
###About my quest
In November 2011, I left my manufacturing engineering position in Boston, MA and I found myself with an amazing, albeit daunting, opportunity to find my passion. My husband and I moved closer to family and I started on my quest to find a career that encompasses everything I love:

* deductive reasoning

* problem solving

* building professional relationships

* teaching and getting others interested and involved  

* time and project management

I feel that Ruby and Rails development will allow me to apply all of these skills.

###My previous experience with customer support
It can be argued that I have worked in *customer support* for several years. Manufacturing, like most industries, is based on an interconnected web of supplier-customer relationships. As a manufacturing engineer I acted as the regulator for these relationships. 	

Operators were my most demanding customers and interacting with them was the best part of my job. I trained them to use the different machines and wrote documentation for their future reference. I also ensured their machines produced quality product and allowed them to do their jobs in the most effective manner possible.

I was also the line of communication between the operators and the design/mechanical engineering staff. I participated in design reviews where I voiced the issues operators were having with certain designs and, in turn, I spoke with the operators about upcoming design changes.
	 


###Why am I a good match for github?
####I am...

* **a problem solver**

As a manufacturing engineer one of my primary functions was "problem solver". This included customer and supplier issues, design problems and machine maintenance.

* **personable**

In my final year at RIT, I worked on a capstone project with my entire senior class (11 people). I was selected to be the voice of my capstone group. I presented both our midterm and final presentations to a group of staff which included the head of the department.

* **a creator** 

One of my favorite hobbies is crocheting. I love the feeling of accomplishment associated with the creation of something. I know that something I [made](http://img0.etsystatic.com/il_570xN.312405116.jpg) will keep someone warm.

* **a teacher**

While in my second year of college I started a student chapter of the Society of Manufacturing Engineers(SME).  The group worked on many projects which included the hotdog robot [Version 1:Tabletop](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enmuwG5rOGA) [Version 2: Mobile](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6LXdhUK-wXk). This project was shown at the ImagineRIT festival in Rochester, NY with the hope of getting children interested in engineering.

Also while in college, I was a member of Women in Technology (WIT). Several times a year we invited local girl scouts to RIT to learn about different engineering disciplines. I led the activities for mechanical engineering and material science.

After moving to Buffalo I started a [meetup group](http://www.meetup.com/Buffalo-Crochet/) to share my love of crocheting with the Nickel City. Currently we have 35 members, many of whom are learning the craft. 

* **a student**

I am currently in the process of teaching myself how to program. I am working my way through the web development track on [TeamTreeHouse](http://teamtreehouse.com/) and I’m trying to [Learn Ruby the Hard Way](http://ruby.learncodethehardway.org/). 

I am also attending as many conferences and ruby meetups as possible. I love meeting all of the intelligent people and absorbing as much knowledge as I can from them.

###Current participation in the developer community

* Boston.rb and WNY Ruby Users Meetups

* Attending Conferences - Codemash 2012, RailsConf 2012 

###Professional Goals
* Talk at a conference within 2 years

* Work professionally as a programmer within 5 years

###About me 
#####(the fun, often nerdy, stuff)
* Board games - Carcassonne, 7Wonders, Quarriors, Ticket to Ride

* Cooking - I am currently leveling up my bread making skills.

* Crafting - Everything and anything. Yes, [really](http://distilleryimage4.s3.amazonaws.com/2df294264af211e1abb01231381b65e3_7.jpg).

* Reading - I just finished “Ready Player One” by Ernest Cline. A very good read that is made for every nerd.

Thank you for reading and for your consideration. I look forward to hearing from you.
