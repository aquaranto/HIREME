###Who am I?
Hi there! I am Amanda Quaranto: an engineer turned novice programmer.

###About my quest
In November 2011, I left my manufacturing engineering position in Boston, MA and I found myself with an amazing, albeit daunting, opportunity to find my passion. My husband and I moved closer to family and I started on my quest to find a career that encompasses everything I love:

* deductive reasoning

* problem solving

* building professional relationships

* teaching and getting others interested and involved  

* time and project management

I feel that Ruby and Rails development will allow me to apply all of these skills.

###Why am I a good fit?
####I am...

* **a problem solver**

As a manufacturing engineer one of my primary functions was "problem solver". This included customer/supplier issues, design problems, and machine programming and maintenance.

* **personable**

In my final year at RIT, I worked on a capstone project with my entire senior class (11 people). I was selected to be the voice of my capstone group. I presented both our midterm and final presentations to faculty, including the head of the department.

* **a creator** 

One of my favorite hobbies is crocheting. I love the feeling of accomplishment associated with the creation of something. I know that something I made will keep someone warm.

* **a teacher**

While in my second year of college I started a student chapter of the Society of Manufacturing Engineers(SME).  The group worked on many projects which included programming the hotdog robot [Version 1:Tabletop](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enmuwG5rOGA), [Version 2: Mobile](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6LXdhUK-wXk). This project was shown at the ImagineRIT festival in Rochester, NY with the hope of getting children interested in engineering.

Also while in college, I was a member of Women in Technology (WIT). Several times a year we invited local girl scouts to RIT to learn about different engineering disciplines. I led the activities for mechanical engineering and material science.

I recently started a [meetup group](http://www.meetup.com/Buffalo-Learning-to-Code/) to share my love of programming with the Nickel City. Currently we have 11 members, many of whom are programming for the very first time. I also started posting all of my solutions for the 'students' to [refer to](https://github.com/aquaranto/PineLTPAnswers) on github.

I also regularly attend the local [knitting](http://www.meetup.com/Public-Knitters-Unite/) meetup and host the [crocheting](http://www.meetup.com/Buffalo-Crochet/) meetup.

* **a student**

I am currently in the process of teaching myself how to program. I worked my way through Chris Pine's Learn to Program Book and I am currently working through Why's Poignant Guide to Ruby.

I am also attending as many conferences and ruby meetups as possible. I love meeting all of the intelligent people and absorbing as much knowledge as I can from them.
